Airport Challenge
(I deleted your beautiful ASCII plane, apologies)

This is a implementation of https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge, made with sweat, tea, a warm blanket and some swearing.

so far:
- Implemented a Plane class, representing..planes.
- Add an internal state and accessors method to be able to tell if airborne or not (test edge cases)
- Implemented a Airport class, to act as container and controller of planes.
- Add internal storage and methods to be able to store, land and dispatch planes.
- Add Airport methods to switch landed/airborne status of planes being launched/landed
- Implemented a Weather class, to dispatch weather updates
- Add Weather methods to change weather randomly or to a given value, and to read it
- Made my beautiful methods ugly and went through great pains to avoid including the Weather class in the Airport one


TODO how i implemented stuff
